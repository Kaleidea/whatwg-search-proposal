#### Suppression

I've tried many times to discuss these matters politely with Domenic. He had [strong negative feelings]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-961877504 ) about my disagreement. He never discussed technical details and ignored all the evidence I've presented. The discussion became unprofessional.

After I made a [clear statement]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-964879335 ) about the issues of miscommunication, he started [suppressing]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7323#issuecomment-965145881 ) and [censoring]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7320#pullrequestreview-802253725 ) my comments.

Domenic hasn't responded to me since November.


#### Abuse of authority

In December I've prepared the implementation for an origin trial to acquire real-world data on the debated risks and resolve the disagreement. As soon as Domenic was informed about my intent, *within 3 minutes* he instructed the chromestatus.com admin to revoke my access, thus preventing the path to a resolution. This is in stark contrast with the [WHATWG's working mode]( https://whatwg.org/working-mode#conflicts ). The trial could be underway by now.

The behavior that benefits Chromium development would have been to facilitate communication with the Chromium team and support the implementation. By this time the origin trial might be in progress, but 2 months were lost due to animus.

These and other counterproductive actions necessitated a [code of conduct complaint]( https://github.com/whatwg/sg/issues/186 ). Unfortunately, the Steering Group was unable to provide remedy due to conflict of interest and [lack of established procedures]( https://github.com/whatwg/sg/issues/186#issuecomment-998039534 ).

Continuing this pattern, the implementations and the 2 months' work I've done wasn't even mentioned in this W3C TAG review. It is clear that the intent is to make my work disappear.


#### Personal note

It is very difficult to "collaborate" in this manner. I am very disappointed by the animosity that I've experienced and that 2 months of my work means nothing. A disagreement about technical questions should not lead to this outcome in a professional environment. Domenic doesn't need to be always right to be the most productive and respected standards editor.

I hope that this clear summary of the issues will help people responsible for upholding the [code of conduct]( https://whatwg.org/code-of-conduct ) to take the proper actions and remedy this situation.
